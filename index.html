				<p>Hello! My name is Matej Bakala, and I am a third-year Bachelor's student in Informatics and Management at the Faculty of Management and Informatics, University of Zilina in Slovakia. With a passion for technology and problem-solving, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a real-world setting. As I continue expanding my expertise in programming and web development, I am actively seeking my first opportunity in the field to grow both professionally and personally.</p>

            <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
            <hr>
            <div class="experience-content">
                <p>Since I haven't worked in the computer science field yet, my experience comes entirely from my studies. During my time at the University of Žilina, I have developed a strong foundation in Java, C, and C++, with a focus on object-oriented programming. I've also gained a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures, as well as experience in scripting and coding in a Linux environment. To broaden my skill set, I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development. In this semester, I am also studying C#, .NET, and Kotlin, further enhancing my knowledge of programming languages and frameworks.
				<br><br>
				Alongside my studies, I work part-time as online support for an advertising website. This job strengthenes my problem-solving and communication skills as I deal with customer inquiries and handle advertising tickets. Through this experience, I have developed a strong ability to understand clients' needs, ensuring their concerns are addressed effectively. I have also gained experience working independently, managing tasks efficiently, and maintaining a high level of attention to detail.</p>
